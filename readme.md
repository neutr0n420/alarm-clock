* Recommend setting up your dev environment before signing up for any issue.

* Clone it onto your PC.

* Create a folder with your github username.

* Prefer starting with issues labeled as good first issue.(https://github.com/SJ-Kumar/studentfolio/issues)

* Always comment on the issue first to check if it's available. If it is, it will be assigned to you, and you are given 4 days to complete it. If the deadline is not met, the issue is free to be taken by somebody else. This way we want to avoid multiple people working on the same issue.

* When done, make sure your PR description shows a screenshot of the newly implemented feature so that person who will review your code will not need to run your code locally.

* Once your PR is approved (with label of "Hacktoberfest-Accepted") your name will be automatically listed in the shiny super "contributors"list ðŸ˜Ž
